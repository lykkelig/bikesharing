# Module 14 - NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of Project
Investigate the possibility of implementing a bike sharing program in Des Moines similar to the one in New York City (NYC).
To perform this investigation we will use the NY Citibike dataset. 
The data set consists of the following data elements that will assist with our investigation:
Year of birth
End Station ID
End Station Latitude
End Station Longitude
End station Name
Gender
Start Station ID
Start Station Latitude
Start Station Longitude
Start Station Name
Start Time
Stop Time
Trip Duration
User Type

## Analysis Visualizing the Data with Tableau
* [Atomic:] If we examine the first graph (upper left) in the story, "Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)", it clearly shows that
            most bike usage is done to get to and from work, see this story: (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ron.hankey/viz/BikeTripAnalysis_16491112034190/TripStory?publish=yes) The times associated with the highest ridership is when one would expect users to be going to and from work. 
* [Atomic:] If we move to the right and look at the graph labeled "User Trips by Gender by Weekday", it is clear that males are the 
            vast majority of bike users. Also of note is that Thursday is the day of heaviest bike usage by both genders.    
            Story: (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ron.hankey/viz/BikeTripAnalysis_16491112034190/TripStory?publish=yes).  
* [Atomic:] Scrolling down to the lower right hand corner, "Trips by Weekday per Hour" https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ron.hankey/viz/BikeTripAnalysis_16491112034190/TripStory?publish=yes clearly shows the busiest communiting times are 8:00 - 9:00 AM and
            5:00 to 7:00 PM. 
* [Atomic:] In the lower right corner, the graph "Checkout Times by Gender", again show that males are the majority of bike share 
            users.
* [Atomic:] The last page in the story with one visual, "Popularity of Start Stations", shows that most of the bike trips are made 
            in the borough of Manhattan.           


## Summary  Can data from New York City be applied to Des Moines?
* [Atomic:] In order for the data to be useful for consideration in Des Moines, additional data elements would need to be applied.
            The number one would probably be weather, the temperature should also be considered in this analysis. Des Monies has much colder winters than NYC and more snow and ice to contend with. 
* [Atomic:] One obvious data point that needs to be examined is the disparity in gender ridership. This needs to be explored in more
            detail perhaps with the addition of surveys. Why do women use the bikes so much less then men? Is a factor of clothing or safety? These are questions that would need to be explored.
